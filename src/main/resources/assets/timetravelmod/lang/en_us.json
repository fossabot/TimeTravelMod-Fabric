A Time Machine is a multi-block structure made with four different blocks: basic blocks (the structure), core blocks (the engine), upgrade blocks (these change behaviour), and a control panel. You may choose to place an upgrade block in any place where a basic block is valid. After you've built your Time Machine, go inside it and right-click the control panel. A menu will allow you to select your destination Time Line. The available Time Lines will depend on the Time Machine tier. Select one and you will Time Travel for the first time. The Time Machine's engine needs a moment to cool down before you can use it again. If you try to mine the engine while it's cooling down, it will explode, leaving a time hole. There is also a very low chance of a Temporal Explosion occurring any time you use a Time Machine.",
